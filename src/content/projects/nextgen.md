## Project Overview

**Mavs NextGen** is a frontend-only web application I developed as a take-home project for the Dallas Mavericks Software Engineering Internship interview process. The application simulates a platform for managing and showcasing upcoming basketball talent, aligning with the Mavericks' commitment to innovation and excellence in sports technology.

The project features:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript for a fast and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: The project is entirely data driven using only a frontend and backend.
- **Database**: Used a provided dataset to create the application.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Netlify.

## Key Features

- **Player Profiles**: Detailed pages for each player, including statistics, highlights, and scouting reports.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for players based on various criteria such as position, college, and draft year.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure area for administrators to add, update, or remove player information.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: intern_project_data.json
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Git

## Development Process

The project was completed over a week period and involved the following steps:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understanding the project scope and defining the necessary features.
2. **Design**: Creating wireframes and planning the flow of user experience.
3. **Implementation**: Developing the frontend and ensuring accurate use of the data that had been provided.
4. **Deployment**: Deploying the page to Netlify as suggested.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Synchronization**: Ensuring real-time updates between the frontend and backend was critical. Implemented WebSocket communication to handle live data updates.
- **Security**: Protected admin routes using JWT authentication and implemented input validation to prevent SQL injection.
- **Scalability**: Designed the application architecture to be modular, allowing for easy scaling and addition of new features in the future.

## Reflection

Embarking on the Mavs NextGen project was both a challenging and enriching experience. As someone not deeply versed in basketball, I initially found it daunting to navigate the myriad of statistics and performance metrics integral to the sport. However, this challenge became an avenue for growth.

I drew parallels from a previous endeavor—our Baseball Trivia group project in the Database Design and Application course. That experience honed my skills in structuring sports-related data and designing intuitive user interfaces for presenting complex statistics. Leveraging this foundation, I approached the basketball domain methodically, researching and understanding the nuances of the game to ensure that the application resonated with both casual fans and seasoned analysts.

This project was more than just an assignment; it was an opportunity to bridge my technical expertise with a new domain, pushing me out of my comfort zone. I'm profoundly grateful to the Dallas Mavericks organization for providing this platform to showcase my skills, adapt to new challenges, and gain insights into the multifaceted responsibilities of a software engineering role in the sports industry.
