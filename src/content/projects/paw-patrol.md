## Project Overview

**Paw Patrol** was the template-based class project for Baylor's *Software Engineering II* course in Spring 2025. The project simulated a real-world full-stack development scenario with a robust setup across multiple teams. The application helps users browse and adopt pets through a modern interface backed by a Java Spring API, React frontend, MySQL database, and CI/CD deployment on GCP.

The provided template included:

- **Backend** (`/pet-adoption-api`) â€” Java Spring Boot API
- **Frontend** (`/pet-adoption-frontend`) â€” React with Material UI
- **CI/CD & Docker** â€” Sample Dockerfiles and GitHub Actions workflows for deployment

> The project was intended to mimic professional development workflows, including containerized deployment, self-hosted GitHub runners, and production infrastructure setup using Google Cloud.

## My Role and Contributions

I participated in this project across **two separate teams**, providing leadership and engineering expertise in different phases.

### ðŸ§  Team 4 â€“ Project Manager

In the initial month of the project, I served as the **Project Manager** for Team 4. My responsibilities included:

- Overseeing the design and technical direction of the platform.
- Developing a clean, accessible frontend using React and Material UI.
- Implementing multiple backend APIs using Java Spring Boot to support the application's core features.

Despite technical progress, our team encountered challenges related to collaboration and communication. Due to concerns raised by our professor, the group was ultimately reorganized.

### ðŸŽ¯ Team 1 â€“ Design Engineer

After the restructure, I joined **Team 1** where I specialized as a **Design Engineer**. This transition allowed me to focus deeply on feature development and data modeling. Key contributions included:

- **Pet Data Set Creation**: Built a comprehensive dataset of thousands of pets for use in the app.
- **Like/Dislike Features**: Implemented intuitive user interaction components that allowed users to rate pets.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Refined the self-feeding recommendation system that scores and suggests pets based on user preferences and interactions.

My work in Team 1 directly contributed to the personalization and intelligence layer of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material UI
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot, Gradle, Lombok
- **Database**: MySQL (Dockerized)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GCP VM (self-hosted runners), Docker Compose
- **Dev Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, ESLint, Prettier

## Reflection

This project gave me valuable experience managing technical teams, writing scalable backend services, and deploying real-world applications. It challenged me to adapt quickly in a dynamic classroom environment and collaborate across teams under changing circumstances.

It also reinforced the importance of DevOps skills like CI/CD, Docker, and cloud deploymentâ€”essential capabilities for modern software engineering roles.
