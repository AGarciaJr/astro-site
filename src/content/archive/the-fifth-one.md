I am actually writing this on the sixth! Boohoo, but that's just how crazy these times are.

I've been working on getting my semester long projects for Software Engineering II
and Database Design and Application polished.

You can already take a look at Paw Patrol in the projects section, but I'll give a 
quick rundown of my Database project.

Throughout the semester we worked on learning the ins and outs of a baseball database.

This application is a basic trivia game where a user can answer as many baseball
related questions as they like.

I worked on creating a basic frontend, question generators, and minigames.
