## Overviews

Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend **Spectrum Sizzle**, an NSF-funded undergraduate workshop hosted at **Baylor University**. The event was designed to expose students to real-world wireless spectrum challenges through hands-on labs, academic lectures, and professional panels.

I was invited to participate by **Tom Brooks**, Director of Business Development at SMART Hub, who I originally met during my freshman year in his professional development course. Thanks to that connection, I recieved an invitation to an eye opening experience.

## My Role

I was assigned to the **Yellow Team**, which rotated through a series of technical lectures and laboratory exercises with students from various universities. These sessions covered a diverse range of topics including radar systems, passive spectrum sensing, communication systems, policy, and circuit design.

## Highlights

### üî¨ Hands-On Radar Lab

One of my favorite sessions was the **Radar System Testing lab**. It was both engaging and fun‚Äîwe literally ran in front of a radar system to generate and observe our own data. It helped solidify my understanding of radar principles in a way that traditional lectures couldn‚Äôt.



### üõ∞Ô∏è Spectrum Analysis Foxhunt

The **Spectrum Analysis and Frequency Allocations lab**, supported by **Keysight Technologies**, was another standout. We worked alongside Keysight liaisons in a ‚Äúfoxhunt‚Äù exercise‚Äîsearching around campus to locate hidden transmitters using spectrum analyzers. It combined technical skill with teamwork in a truly memorable way.

## Panels & Personal Growth

### üéì Graduate School Panel

The **Graduate School Panel** made a lasting impact. One moment in particular has stuck with me: **Dr. Baylis** described the difference between degree levels by saying, *‚ÄúA bachelor‚Äôs degree makes you an implementer. A PhD makes you an innovator.‚Äù* That statement shifted how I view academic advancement and opened my eyes to the possibilities of graduate study.

## Community & Collaboration

The workshop wasn‚Äôt just about academics‚Äîit was also about building community. I formed meaningful connections with my teammates and students from other universities. Whether it was during our nightly group reflections or racing across campus during the foxhunt, the collaborative spirit was palpable and energizing.

## Final Thoughts

**Would I recommend Spectrum Sizzle to other students? Absolutely.** It‚Äôs a rare opportunity to get hands-on with advanced technology, hear directly from field experts, and get a glimpse into the possibilities that graduate study and research can offer. It was not only intellectually enriching‚Äîit was genuinely fun.

I left the week feeling inspired, challenged, and more certain than ever that I want to keep learning, building, and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in tech.
