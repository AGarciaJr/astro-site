description: "Staying consistent."

Nothing crazy, just staying consistent. I think once the summer starts, these posts will actually start to take the shape I want them to.

They’ll be more focused on Computer Science topics, which I’m excited about. Here's a rough list of things I want to write about in the future:

## Topics I Want to Cover

- **LeetCode Problems**
- **Computer Science UIL**
- **Research**
- **Miscellaneous**
  - Books
  - Music/Shows
  - Movies

For now, I’m just glad I sat down and wrote something. One post at a time.
