    <p>Hi! I'm Alex, a Computer Science student at Baylor and a future software engineer with a growing passion for databases and AI. I'm currently exploring research opportunities while building up my portfolio through personal projects and freelance work.</p>

    <p>
      I got into software development because, where I'm from, it's rare â€” there's no CS curriculum back home. That gap drives me. Short term, I'm looking to work in industry and learn from experienced engineers. Long term, I want to build pathways for underrepresented communities to discover and thrive in tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of coding, I love reading, watching movies, listening to music, and I've recently taken up golf. I'm actively job hunting, preparing for Baylor's 4+1 program, and working on tools that help people.
